# Batvision-tf

## ✨ Unofficial Tensorflow Implementation for the BatVision dataset

### 📝 Paper title: [The Audio-Visual BatVision Dataset for Research on Sight and Sound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07257)
### 🗃️ Datasets: [BatvisionV1 and BatvisionV2](https://cloud.minesparis.psl.eu/index.php/s/qurl3oySgTmT85M) 
*Note: Currently Only V2 is supported in this repository*
### 🥅 The objective is to ingest the dataset and to benchmark a model zoo, with variable complexities, against the Cycle GAN UNet used by the authors as a high performing baseline
